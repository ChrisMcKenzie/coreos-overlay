# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.

# recent releases

# Block new binutils, the amd64 kernel can't uncompress when built with it.
